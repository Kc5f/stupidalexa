# stupidalexa
Your worst home assistant of all time. Highly simple. Highly customizable.

## How to run:
Simply download the StupidAlexaâ„¢ GitHub repository and host it using any webserver of your choice. It must be hosted however, because it requires permanent microphone access.

I've only tested it using Google Chrome, because Firefox didn't seem to work, but you can test other browsers if you want (NO REFUNDS).
